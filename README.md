I wanted to horn my skills in Rx.js and Ramda (Functional Reactive Programming).

## How to use
`npm install` then;

1) `$ node create KYU_LEVEL PROBLEM_NAME FUNCTION_NAME` makes `./src/PROBLEM_NAME/main.js` with FUNCTIO_NAME as boilerplate, Solve using Rx.js, and Ramda
Example;
```bash
node create 8 RemoveFirstAndLastCharacter removeChar
```
2) `$ rollup -c` makes `./src/PROBLEM_NAME/build.js`, paste contents to answer pane of your choice such as Codewars

Tested in Codewars environment.
