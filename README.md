# Practice Rx.js and Ramda to solve toy problems 
Got sick of for loops even JavaScript API. I wanted to horn my skills in Rx.js and Ramda (Functional Reactive Programming).

## How to use
`npm install` then;

1) `$ node create PROBLEM_NAME` makes `./src/PROBLEM_NAME/main.js`, Solve using Rx.js, and Ramda
2) `$ rollup -c` makes `./src/PROBLEM_NAME/build.js`, paste contents to answer pane of your choice such as Codewars

See src/multiply for an example.







Tested in Codewars environment
